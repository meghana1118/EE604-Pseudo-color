# EE604-Pseudo-color

Abstract

A false- colour image is an image that depicts an object in colours that differ from those a photograph (a true-colour image) would show. 
A pseudo-colour is derived from a greyscale image by mapping each intensity value to a colour according to a table or function. 
Pseudo colour is typically used when a single channel of data is available (e.g. temperature, elevation, soil composition, tissue type, and so on),
in contrast to false colour which is commonly used to display three channels of data. 
In this project I have written a MATLAB code to convert images obtained from google to show example for both false and pseudo colour.
